<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

<!-- ![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16707738/92399059-5716eb00-f132-11ea-8b14-bcacdc8ec97b.png) -->

<!-- Write an overview text here -->
<!-- Going to clean up the css code -->

 <!-- Things to fix:
    -   When the '.burgerBtn' menu also has the classname '.open',
        -   change the classname of the burgerBtn to '.fixed'
        -   The '.fixed' classname has the following properties:
            -   position: fixed;
            -   top: 13px;
            -   right: 6%;
        -   In order to make the exit button visible even when you scroll down
            the navigation menu(which is covering the screen)

    -    When the mobile nav menu is open(covering the whole screen),
        -   Change so user can't access anything else on the web site with the tab
        -   While the nav menu is open, disable the tab of other links, inputs,
        and buttons on the site.
    -    Javascript has some sort of event method/attribute that controls
          the ending of transitions and animations.
          I recall it from the '30 days of JavaScript', the modal with the 'drumset'.

    -    Minify the css, to make the file smaller.
    Learned the basics of parcel to bundle and minify the html, js, and the css
